Signing up for an AWS Account
#############################

To use the |sdk-net| to access AWS, you need an AWS account. You also need credentials for
individual services, such as |s3| or |ec2|. You acquire those credentials in a profile for the |sdk-net|
when you create your first sample app [add link].

Sign up for an AWS Account
==========================

    #. Open http://aws.amazon.com/ and choose :guilabel:`Create a Free Account`. This might be
       unavailable in your browser if you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console.
       In that case, choose :guilabel:`Sign in to a different account`, and then choose :guilabel:`Create a new AWS account`.

    #. Follow the onscreen instructions.

       Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using
       your phone keypad.

After signing up for an AWS account, you can use |CFN| through the AWS Management Console,
|CFN| API, or AWS CLI.

Pricing
=======

AWS offers you a `pay-as-you-go approach <https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/>`_ for pricing for
over 70 cloud services. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need,
for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.
You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no
additional costs or termination fees.

For more information about AWS pricing, go to the detail page for each product on http://aws.amazon.com.
For example, see `aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`_ for |S3long|
pricing.

To view your current account activity and manage your account at any time, go to
`http://aws.amazon.com <http://aws.amazon.com>`_ and choose :guilabel:`My Account/Billing and Cost Management Dashboard`.
