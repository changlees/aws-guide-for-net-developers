There are three cloud deployment models : cloud, hybrid, and on-premises.

Cloud Deployment Model
----------------------

A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run
in the cloud. Applications in the cloud are either created in the cloud or are
migrated from an existing infrastructure to benefit from cloud computing.
Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces, or can use higher-level
services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of
core infrastructure.

Hybrid Deployment Model
-----------------------

A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based
resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method
of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend
and grow an organization's infrastructure into the cloud, while connecting cloud resources to the
internal system. 

On-Premises Deployment Model
----------------------------

Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes
referred to as a "private cloud". On-premises deployment doesn't provide many of the benefits of cloud
computing. However, it's sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases
this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, while using application management
and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization.
